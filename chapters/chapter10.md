# Week 9

Alright ! I have been on a huge gap from this GSOC-Book. But I retrieved all the required information and series of event in order of their occurances to remember this beautiful time of GSOC as I grow into old man. So, Let's start with the work. 
I have had my Difference TreeMaps at their place and found a silly mistake in stratifying the data for the Sunburst. So, I have created a Sunbust out of the existing data but I still was facing the issues while labelling the Sunburst. 

Since Guilherme was about to get back to his office from the vacations, I was also at my home doing my chores and preparing the Presentation for C4GT program and giving tests for interns and waiting for replies from good companies in case they need me but got none of it yet. So, Due to very busy schedule of both of us, We had a meet at end of week on Friday. So, All I gave as update was that I created the Difference treeMap and the Sunburst.

Here is the preview of the Sunburst.

Then In the meet he suggested me that, It would be good to separate out the reports into two major parts one specifically for the Raw Reports and another for difference report. So, I worked next week for doing that tasks.

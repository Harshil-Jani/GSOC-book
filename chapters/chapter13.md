# Final Closing

After many days of hectic work , I am finally back again to close the book with my last notes.
My mentor Amadio, merged the final changes into the g4run and then also he changed the css based on W3 Styles. Now the site looks really well. He then ran a jenkins report which was a successfull run. 

// To be continued, Just wanted to check the status.
